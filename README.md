# CS_305_module05_assignment_home_library
For NAU CS305 class we are creating different repositories.

A recent project idea that was proposed to me was one from my mother. She teaches piano to multiple students and lends her music books out to different students from time to time. Recently she had one parent decide that they no longer wished to have their children take piano with her. At the time, my mother didn't realize that there were still a large number of books that she had let that parent's students take until she was looking for books that no longer on her shelf. When she aproached the parent about it they said they had already gotten rid of the books. My mother asked me to either look for or create a library that she could use to track her books. Something lightweight but also comprehensive. My mother is also part of an organization of piano teaches who might also be interested in using a similar application. For purposes of requirements, teachers or teacher is someone who has a library of music books that they may lend to students While discussing building an application, we came up with the following requirements: 
* Able to store all current books in teacher's library information including: 
  * Title of the book
  * Composer/compiler of book
  * Level of music
  * Optional purchase costs
  * Instrument the music is for. Able to include duet books that include music such as cello and piano parts.
  * Notes for wear and tear
* Student information
  * When the student started
  * What their current level is
  * What books they have currently checked out. These should match or link to books found in the library.
  * When they checked out current books 
  * What learning books teacher has bought for the individual student that the student/family will be keeping. Some teachers get discounts at music stores for being part of an organization.
This application may also be used further down the line to address other tools my mother uses while teaching including but not limited to:
* Scheduling students.
* Tracking lesson payment.
* Creation of assignment or lesson plans for parents to have digitally. 
* Library inventory could be linked across applications so that when other people get a new book that someone else already has the information could be synced. They won't have to put stuff in.
